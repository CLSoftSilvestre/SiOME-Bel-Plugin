|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Quickstart

To setup Angular, follow the instructions in the [Angular setup guide](https://angular.dev/guide/setup-local).

Make sure to install the right [dependency versions](https://angular.dev/guide/versions). 
A version manager like [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) can provide more flexibility when changing between projects with different angular versions later down the line.

Install all dependencies of the project:

```bash
npm install
```

To build the project as a plugin for SiOME:

```bash
npm run build-plugin
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/releases` directory.
